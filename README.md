# Kishotenketsu Patch it Later
This level design project was given to our class by our professor. We were tasked to use the technique of Kishotenketsu, used by the game developers in Nintendo, to make a level. using his game that he created.

## Kishotenketsu
Kishotenketsu is a technique on how to tell a story without conflict. It starts off with the introduction, then development, a twist, and finally a conclusion. We used this to teach the player a new mechanic or power.

### Introduction
In this stage, We introduce the player the new mechanic or power to the player. We show what the mechanic can and cannot do. We also provide a safe environment. By providing a safe environment, the player can feel safe to try out any idea that comes to mind.

### Development
In this stage, we test the players skills by removing the safety of the environment and testing their abilities. This means that if the mechanic is spatial then we test out platforming.

### Twist
In this stage, we give a twist to the mechanic, by providing a different view of the mechanic the players can try something new. We also provide an environment suited for the twist.
